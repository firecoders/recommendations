Table of contents
-----------------
- [Books](#books)

### Books
#### [Higher-Order Perl](http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/HigherOrderPerl.pdf)
Functional programming in perl. It gets pretty crazy, like trying to implement
currying. Read it if you have to use perl for some reason or want a taste of
functional programming in a stateful environment.

#### [How to Design Programs](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html)
A book about desinging programs. Some blog recommended it, but I haven't read
it yet, so I can't testify on its quality. Might be interesting or total
bullshit.

#### [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
A great book to get started with the haskell programming language.

#### [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
An introduction to operating system architecture.

#### [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/en/index.html)
A book describin how to run a successful open source project.

#### [Programming Pearls](http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~deepak/deepak/placement/Programming_pearls.pdf)
A collection of essays of developers describing interesting problems they were
confronted with and how they went about solving them.

#### [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf)
Actually not a book but a PhD thesis. Given its contents and its size of 162
pages, I'll still count it as a book though. The examples seem to be in ML, but
I believe it could still prove quite useful in the haskell world.

#### [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
An old MIT textbook explaining the fundamental concepts of Computer Science.
A lot of very smart people recommend it, so it's probably worth a read.

#### [The Architecture of Open-Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
A series of books in which open source developers explain the (code) design of
their applications. Maybe some nice insights into software architecture.

#### [The Cathedral and the Bazzar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)
A classic. This book is about the benefits about the FOSS development process.
